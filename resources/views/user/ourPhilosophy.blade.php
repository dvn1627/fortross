    <h2 class="h1">Our philosophy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No predictions: focus on fully systematic strategies that develop and exploit persistent statistical trading edge</li>
        <li>
            Intuitive simplicity with strong links to reality: models with a few robust parameters stable over time and over multiple market regimes:
            <ul>
                <li>Fundamental (unemployment, consumer sentiment etc)</li>
                <li>Changes in momentum, inter- and intra-market correlations, terms structures and their dynamics etc</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>No shooting from the hip: robust trading strategies, disciplined execution of systematic trades</li>
        <li>Emphasis on liquidity: same-day or next-day liquidity</li>
    </ul>
